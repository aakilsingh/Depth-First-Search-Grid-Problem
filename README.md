# Problem Statement 
Create a console application that solves a maze using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
 
**Maze Representation:** Represent a maze as a 2D grid where:
- 0 represents an open path.
- 1 represents a wall.
- S represents the starting point.
- E represents the endpoint.

**Example maze**

```
S 1 0 0 0  
0 1 0 1 0  
0 0 0 1 0  
1 1 0 1 0  
0 0 0 0 E
```
- The program should take a maze as input and display the steps taken to solve it.
- The output should clearly show the path from the starting point to the endpoint, using * to represent the path taken.
